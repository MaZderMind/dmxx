DMXx - a programmable DMX Proxy
===============================

The DMXx is a truely programmable DMX-Proxy which can be plugged in between the simple DMX-Controller and our fixtures. It can be used to do simple channel mappings and calculations, react to external stimuli (Light-Switches, Food-Pedals), do time-dependent things, implement different modes and do all the things, your simple controller is not capable of.
